# Production setup dependencies
#
# In general:
#   - put one dependency per line
#   - constraining versions is recommended
#       e.g. multinet==0.2.2
#   - multiple constraints should be on one line
#       e.g. multinet>=0.1.3,<0.2.2,!=0.2.1
#   - including all specs from another setup is allowed
#     (refer to the setup's TXT file; best practice = give full path)
#       e.g. -r some_other_setup.txt
#
# If you're developing a package in /path/to/my/dev/package/,
# you can include that as well
#   e.g. /home/cfsd/me/my_package/
